The present thinking, influenced greatly by molecular modeling simulations
beginning in the 1980s, is that on a very short time scale (less than a
picosecond), water is more like a "gel" consisting of a single, huge
hydrogen-bonded cluster. On a 10-12-10-9 sec time scale, rotations and other
thermal motions cause individual hydrogen bonds to break and re-form in new
configurations, inducing ever-changing local discontinuities whose extent and
influence depends on the temperature and pressure.
